          This is a full-stack MERN application. Three months before this
          project none of the developers knew anything about React, Node,
          Express, or Mongoose.
          <br />
          The main functionality of Hey, Neighbor is to provide users with a
          marketplace to rent items, offer services, and search for either.{" "}

            <Card.Text>
              Cultivated at peak summer season, I love being outdoors trying to
              soak in what little Washington sun is given. I learned a ton of
              technical things on this project, but also got my first real
              experience working on a team. Learning the git work flow furthered
              my learning journey in software development.

              Software engineer with a background in technology sales, enjoys
              nerding out with friends over tabletop games and solving complex

              part was taking on the role of project manager during our backend
              planning and development stage.
